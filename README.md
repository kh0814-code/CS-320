Reflection: Software Testing and Quality Assurance Projects
In this course, I worked on two projects that helped me explore software testing, automation, and quality assurance. From Project One, I submitted the Contact service files—Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, and ContactServiceTest.java—which show my ability to build and test Java classes using JUnit. From Project Two, I submitted a summary and reflections report that outlines my understanding of testing strategies and how they connect to real-world requirements.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was getting enough code coverage with my JUnit tests. I struggled with writing tests that fully exercised all branches of my code, and some parts of the ContactService class were especially tricky to cover. Despite my efforts, I didn’t reach the coverage goals I had hoped for, but I’m actively working on improving this. I’ve been revisiting my test cases, analyzing coverage reports, and learning how to write more targeted tests to catch edge cases and missed logic.

To ensure my code is functional and secure, I’ve focused on input validation, exception handling, and writing tests that simulate realistic user interactions. Even though I’m still refining my testing approach, I’ve learned how important it is to think critically about how users might break or misuse a program—and how to design safeguards against that.

Interpreting user needs was a key part of both projects. I started by reviewing the requirements and thinking through how the program should behave from a user’s perspective. This helped me design features that were practical and relevant, and it guided how I structured my tests to reflect real use cases.

When it comes to designing software, I’ve learned to break problems into smaller parts and build them step by step. I’ve also realized how valuable it is to write clean, modular code that’s easier to test and maintain. Even though I hit some roadblocks, I’ve grown more confident in my ability to troubleshoot and iterate until things work.

Overall, these projects pushed me to think more deeply about quality assurance and the role of testing in software development. I’m still learning, but I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and committed to continuing to improve my testing skills as I move forward in the Computer Science program.
