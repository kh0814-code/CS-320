Reflection: Software Testing and Quality Assurance Projects
In this course, I worked on two projects that helped me build practical skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. From Project One, I submitted the Contact service files—Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, and ContactServiceTest.java—which demonstrate my ability to write and test Java classes using JUnit. From Project Two, I submitted a summary and reflections report that highlights my understanding of testing strategies and how to apply them based on project requirements.

To ensure that my code is functional and secure, I focused on writing thorough unit tests that covered both expected and edge-case scenarios. I used JUnit to validate the behavior of my classes and methods, making sure that inputs were handled correctly and that invalid data was caught early. I also paid close attention to exception handling and input validation to prevent potential vulnerabilities or crashes.

Interpreting user needs was a key part of both projects. I started by reviewing the requirements carefully and thinking about how a real user would interact with the program. This helped me design features that were both useful and intuitive. I also made sure that my test cases reflected common user actions, so I could catch bugs before they affected functionality.

When it comes to designing software, I’ve learned to take a modular and test-driven approach. I break down the problem into smaller components, write clean and reusable code, and test each part independently before integrating everything. This makes the code easier to maintain and adapt later on. I also document my work clearly so that others (or future me) can understand the logic and structure without having to dig through every line.

Overall, these projects helped me connect theory to practice and gave me a stronger foundation in writing reliable, maintainable software. I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and excited to keep building on these skills as I move forward in the Computer Science program.
